# Blur Quantifier

This implementation of a blur quantifier module was part of a project entrusted by the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA Lyon) to first year students.
It is intended for research on materials at [MATEIS](https://mateis.insa-lyon.fr/), to study nano and micro-structures using electron microscopy.
This code relies on convolutional filtering techniques (Laplacian, LoG, ...) and was tested on 900 images acquired at the lab.
